## ATmega328P RC-car

This project is for a Arduino powered RC car that is controlled by the movements of your hand. All code was written in Atmel Studio using C and libraries to read and write to registers on the ATmega328P. The Arduino was used to connect physical hardware to the micro-controller.

To compile and upload code, car.c must be uploaded the the Arduino connected to the car chassis, and controller.c must be uploaded to the hand controller. UART and I2C libraries are also necessary to compile code (included in this repo)
