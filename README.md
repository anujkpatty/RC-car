This project is for a Arduino powered RC car that is controlled by the movements of your hand.

To compile and upload code, car.c must be uploaded the the Arduino connected to the car chassis, and controller.c must be uploaded to the hand controller. UART and I2C libraries are also necessary to compile code (included in this repo)
